	\subsection*{Questions}
  \begin{question}
    Let $Y  = \{ M \in \Nomega : \text{ no two members of } M \text{ are
      coprime}\}$. Which $M \in \Nomega$ accept $\{3\}$? Which $M$ reject
    $\{3\}$? Which $M$ reject $\{6\}$?
	% Question 7
  \begin{question}[Question 7]
    Prove that wehenever the collection of finite non-empty sets of $\N$ is
    finitely coloured there exist disjoint $F_1, F_2, \dots$ with $\{\bigcup_{i
      \in I} F_i : \emptyset \neq I \subset \N, I \text{ finite}\}$
    monochromatic.
  \end{question}
  \begin{idea}
    Use Hindman's Theorem
  \end{idea}
  \begin{proof}
    By repeatedly applying Ramsey we can find infinite
    sets $M_1 \supset M_2 \supset \dots$ with $M_i^{(i)}$ monochromatic.
    By Hindman's theorem whenever $\N$ is finitely coloured there exists $x_1, x_2, \dots$ such that $FS(x_1, x_2,
    \dots)$ is monochromatic with WLOG $x_1 < x_2 < \dots$ (If this is not
    the case take $y_1 = x_1$, $y_2 = x_2 + x_3$, $\dots$ which has
    monochromatic finite sums). Then pick an $F_i \in M_{x_i}^{(x_i)}$ for each
    $i$ and we are done.
    \end{proof}
